#Here are some common use cases for browser contexts:

#Isolation: 
#        You can create multiple contexts to isolate different sets of cookies, local storage, and other browsing data. This can be useful for testing scenarios where you want to start with a clean browsing state for each test case.

Parallelization: 
#        By using multiple browser contexts, you can run tests in parallel, as each context operates independently.

#Authentication testing: 
#        You can simulate different authentication scenarios by using separate contexts with different sets of login credentials or authentication tokens.

#Privacy testing: 
#        Browser contexts allow you to test privacy features such as browser fingerprinting or tracking protection by isolating browsing data between contexts.
